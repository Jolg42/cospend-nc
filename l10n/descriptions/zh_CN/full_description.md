# Nextcloud Cospend 💰

Nextcloud Cospend 是一款群组/共享支出管理工具。 由伟大的 [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/) 启发。 由伟大的 [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/) 启发。

您可在租赁房屋、与朋友外出度假时的任何需要共享金钱的情况使用。

It lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.

Project members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.
